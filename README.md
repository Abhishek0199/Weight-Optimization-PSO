# Weight-Optimization-PSO
This repo implements the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the problem of weight optimization for a neural network.

### Introduction :-

Implementing the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm. The classes and other helper functions are implemented in the first section. The algorithm is as follows:
- Generate the initial population
- Calculate the fitness of the particles
- Perform while converges or number of generations:
    - Update the velocity and position of particles
    - Generate the new population
    - Calculate fitness of the new population
    - Update personal and global best
    - Update inertia factor
